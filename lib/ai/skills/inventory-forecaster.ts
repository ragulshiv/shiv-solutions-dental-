CONTEXT:
${contextStr}

TASK:
Analyze the provided inventory consumption data and forecast demand for the next 30/60/90 days.

For EACH item, consider:
1. Average daily consumption rate over the available history
2. Trend direction (increasing, stable, decreasing usage)
3. Current stock level vs. projected consumption
4. Reorder point and lead time
5. Seasonal patterns if detectable

RULES:
- urgency CRITICAL: stockout within 7 days
- urgency SOON: stockout within 14 days
- urgency NORMAL: needs reorder within 30 days
- urgency EXCESS: stock exceeds 90 days of projected usage
- suggestedOrderQty should cover approximately 60 days of projected usage
- Be conservative with projections — do not over-order`,
