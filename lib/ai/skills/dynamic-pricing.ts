RULES:
- All suggestions are ADVISORY only — never auto-apply pricing changes
- Discounts should be between 5-25% to remain profitable
- Premium pricing should be max 15-20% above base
- Consider patient satisfaction — avoid pricing that feels exploitative
- Always include rationale and estimated revenue impact
- Flag any procedures where current pricing seems below market rate`,
