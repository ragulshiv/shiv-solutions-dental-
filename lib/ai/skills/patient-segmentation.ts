CONTEXT:
${contextStr}

TASK:
Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and churn prediction on the provided patient data.

For EACH patient, compute:
1. Recency: days since last visit
2. Frequency: total appointments in last 12 months
3. Monetary: total spend in last 12 months
4. Churn risk: probability of not returning (0-100)

Segment patients into:
- VIP: high frequency + high monetary (top 10%)
- LOYAL: regular visits (4+ per year)
- REGULAR: 2-3 visits per year
- AT_RISK: no visit in 3-6 months
- CHURNING: no visit in 6+ months but was active before
- NEW: registered in last 3 months

Return ONLY valid JSON:

  }
}

RULES:
- churnRisk 0-30 = LOW, 31-60 = MEDIUM, 61-100 = HIGH
- VIP patients should always have LOW churn risk
- NEW patients without follow-up should have MEDIUM churn risk
- Recommendations must be specific and actionable`,
