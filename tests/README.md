# DentalERP — Test Suite

## Overview

The DentalERP test suite uses **Vitest** (unit/integration) and **Playwright** (E2E) to provide comprehensive test coverage across the entire application.

## Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests (Vitest)

```bash
# Run all Vitest tests once
npm test

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run with interactive UI
npm run test:ui

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/unit/utils.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx vitest run -t "billing"
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (requires dev server)
npm run test:e2e

# Run with interactive UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run a specific spec file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts

# Run on a specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run all tests (Vitest + Playwright)
npm run test:all
```

### Coverage

Coverage is configured for `lib/`, `app/api/`, and `components/` directories:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Reports are generated in `coverage/` in text, JSON, and HTML formats.

## Test Architecture

### Mocking Strategy

- **Prisma**: Mocked globally via `tests/__mocks__/prisma.ts` — all DB operations use `vi.fn()` stubs
- **NextAuth**: `auth()` mocked to return configurable session objects per test
- **next/navigation**: `useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams` mocked consistently
- **External services**: Payment gateways, SMS, email all mocked at the module boundary
- **Fetch**: Global fetch is polyfilled in `tests/setup.ts`

### Test Patterns

1. **API tests**: Mock Prisma + auth → call the route handler directly → assert response
2. **Component tests**: Render with RTL → interact → assert DOM state
3. **E2E tests**: Playwright navigates real pages → asserts visible content
4. **Security tests**: Verify crypto, auth flows, injection prevention, header config
5. **Performance tests**: Verify query efficiency patterns, pagination, caching config

### Fixtures & Helpers

- Auth fixtures: `tests/e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` (Playwright auth state)
- Mock data is co-located in each test file for clarity
- `setViewport()` helper in responsive/compatibility tests simulates breakpoints

## CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

| Job                   | Trigger       | What runs                               |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `lint-and-type-check` | PR            | `next lint` + `tsc --noEmit`            |
| `unit-tests`          | PR            | `vitest run` with coverage upload       |
| `e2e-tests`           | merge to main | Playwright with MySQL service container |
| `build`               | PR            | `next build` verification               |

### Git Hooks (Husky)

- **pre-commit**: Runs `lint-staged` (lint + type check on staged files)
- **pre-push**: Runs `npm test` (full Vitest suite)

## Adding New Tests

1. **Choose the right directory** based on what you're testing (see structure above)
2. **Follow existing patterns** — read a similar test file first
3. **Mock at boundaries** — mock Prisma/auth, not internal functions
4. **Use `@ts-nocheck`** at the top of test files to avoid strict type errors from mocks
5. **Name descriptively** — `tests/api/patients.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/billing-invoice.spec.ts`
6. **Keep tests independent** — each test should set up its own data and not depend on order

## Configuration Files

| File                   | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vitest.config.ts`     | Vitest config: jsdom, aliases, coverage, timeouts        |
| `playwright.config.ts` | Playwright: 6 browsers, retries, screenshots, web server |
| `tests/setup.ts`       | Global setup: DOM polyfills, fetch, cleanup              |
